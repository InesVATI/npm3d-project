	abstract = {This paper introduces a new definition of multiscale neighborhoods in 3D point clouds. This definition, based on spherical neighborhoods and proportional subsampling, allows the computation of features with a consistent geometrical meaning, which is not the case when using k-nearest neighbors. With an appropriate learning strategy, the proposed features can be used in a random forest to classify 3D points. In this semantic classification task, we show that our multiscale features outperform state-of-the-art features using the same experimental conditions. Furthermore, their classification power competes with more elaborate classification approaches including Deep Learning methods.},

	volume = {37},
	doi = {10.1080/10106049.2022.2102218},
	abstract = {3D road mapping is essential for intelligent transportation system in smart cities. Road environment receives its data from mobile laser scanning ({MLS}) systems in the format of {LiDAR} point clouds, which are distinguished with their accuracy and high density. In this paper, a mobile {LiDAR} data classification method based on machine learning ({ML}) is presented. First, data subsampling and slicing are applied, followed by cylindrical neighbourhood selection method to determine the neighbourhood of each point. Second, a new {LiDAR}-based point feature namely Zmod is introduced, and used along with existing fifteen geometric features as input for a {ML} algorithm. Finally, Random Forest classifier is applied to a part of (Paris-Lille-3D) {MLS} point clouds belonging to {NPM}3D Benchmark. The dataset is about 1.5 km long road in Lille, France with more than 98 million points. The use of Zmod improved the accuracy from 90.26\% to 95.23\% and achieved sufficient results for classes with low points' portion in the dataset. In addition, the Zmod is the third important feature in the classification process among the sixteen features with about 14.63\%. Moreover, using the first six important features achieved almost the maximum overall accuracy with about 60\% reduction in the processing time.},

	title = {{KPConv}: Flexible and Deformable Convolution for Point Clouds},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08889},
	shorttitle = {{KPConv}},
	abstract = {We present Kernel Point Convolution ({KPConv}), a new design of point convolution, i.e. that operates on point clouds without any intermediate representation. The convolution weights of {KPConv} are located in Euclidean space by kernel points, and applied to the input points close to them. Its capacity to use any number of kernel points gives {KPConv} more flexibility than fixed grid convolutions. Furthermore, these locations are continuous in space and can be learned by the network. Therefore, {KPConv} can be extended to deformable convolutions that learn to adapt kernel points to local geometry. Thanks to a regular subsampling strategy, {KPConv} is also efficient and robust to varying densities. Whether they use deformable {KPConv} for complex tasks, or rigid {KPconv} for simpler tasks, our networks outperform state-of-the-art classification and segmentation approaches on several datasets. We also offer ablation studies and visualizations to provide understanding of what has been learned by {KPConv} and to validate the descriptive power of deformable {KPConv}.},
